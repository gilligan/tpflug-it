## Being successful is hard

Have you heard versions of any of the quotes below in your company?

> "_Shipping simple features takes them forever! It's really expensive_"

> "_We have no idea what the Developers are doing, they don't tell us anything_"

> "_We have no idea what Management is doing, they don't tell us anything_"

> "_They said they can fix it but the release will take a few days!_"

Let me assure you, you are not alone. Being successful in building high quality products and delivering value to your clients is hard, and there are many pitfalls. Often times there are [dysfunctions](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/203596.The_Five_Dysfunctions_of_a_Team) in place which, when left unaddressed, block any meaningful progress.

At the same time, steady delivery of quality software requires a [Craftsmanship mindset](https://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/) and the correct use of state of the art solutions to allow for [Continuous Integration and Delivery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD) that allows you to release without worrying.

## How I will help

I will step in for a defined period, immerse myself in your company and engage with Engineers, Scrum Masters, Product Owners and Stakeholders. This will allow me to evaluate your company's level of technical skills, the communication and collaboration within and between teams, and the practices and workflows that are being used:

Some of the questions that I will look into are:

- How do features go from ideation to shipping?
- How are priorities decided and communicated?
- Where are the bottlenecks in the processes?
- How are features being tested and what is the level of automation?
- How is the infrastructure maintained and what is the level of automation?

The answers to those and other questions will be laid out in my **final report**. The report will outline my findings and offer **clear and actionable suggestions** that will **align with your company goals and culture and help you to move forward**. We will talk about it and discuss next steps.
