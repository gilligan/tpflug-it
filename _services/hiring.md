Hiring is similar to some complex mathematical problems in that it's easy to tell when things don't match up but it's much harder to find the right steps for a good outcome

## How do you hire top talent? 

The most important realisation is that there is no "_one size fits all_" solution to hiring. Whatever works well for Google, Microsoft or GitHub might not be appropriate at all for your company.

What matters is having a hiring process that is based on decisions that are derived from your expectations towards candidates. You need to explcitly decide what is important to you and what you want to filter by and also what _not_ to use as a filter. Don't have candidates carry out tasks that you cannot associate back to written down expectations when you evaluate them.

## How I can help

I will help you to define what it is that you are looking for in candidates and how you can test for this in interviews. Together we can either build or refine your process to make sure it is not longer than it needs to be and that it is actually effective. If you already have a process that you are happy with I can also support you by conducting interviews for you or shadow interviews and give feedback.
