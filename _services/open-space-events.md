Open Space Events are the most empowering and exciting way to bring together people to communicate, collaborate, exchange and brainstorm on a specific question or theme in an extremely scalable manner.

## What does Open Space mean?

[Open Space Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology) describes a method of running a meeting or conference with a certain theme or agenda but without a predefined agenda. There is no distinction between speakers and attendees either, as anyone can decide to actually become the facilitator of a session in the course of the event. The "magic" lies in giving attendees enough structure to self-organize while leaving it up to them to come up with the actual schedule and content.

You can have a look at the following YouTube video to get a better idea of how all of this works: [Open Space Technology - The most engaging all-company meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQj12jmLGr4)
