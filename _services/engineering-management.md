My idea of Engineering Management is all about Servant Leadership. How do I enable and unblock teams and individuals to do their work best as they can, delivering value to the company and customers as efficiently and effectively as possible.

## How to manage Engineers

Engineering Managers should work on making themselves redundant by enabling teams to be as autonomous as possible. Good Engineering Management is not about telling people what to do, it is about fostering an environment where individuals and teams can thrive by focusing on:

- Empowerment
- Vision and Strategy
- Continuous Improvement
- Coaching and Mentoring
- Communication
- Removing Obstacles

## How I will help

As interims Engineering Manager I can help by building, taking over or restructuring your team:

- support the team in picking the right processes and workflows
- lead discussions to agree on standards and best practices
- help the team to boost their productivity

Highly dependent on your needs and current status.
