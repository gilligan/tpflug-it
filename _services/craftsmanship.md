Steadily delivering value to your customers in a sustainable manner is only feasible when you focus on code quality, testing and conscious handling of tech debt. This requires a deliberate effort to raise the bar of professionalism in your Engineering department.

## What is Craftsmanship?

Software Craftsmanship is defined in the [Software Craftsmanship Manifesto](https://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/) as an extension or refinement of the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/). It is short and concise enough to be quoted in full:

> As aspiring Software Craftsmen we are raising the bar of professional software development by practicing it and helping others learn the craft.
> Through this work we have come to value:<br><br>
> Not only working software, **but also well-crafted software**<br>
> Not only responding to change, **but also steadily adding value**<br>
> Not only individuals and interactions, **but also a community of professionals**<br>
> Not only customer collaboration, **but also productive partnerships**<br>
><br>
>That is, in pursuit of the items on the left we have found the items on the right to be indispensable.


## How I will help
