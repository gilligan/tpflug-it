My interest in computers started in the late 80s, learning BASIC on the Amstrad CPC. Since then I have:

- Written lots of low-level C and Assembly on different architectures wrestling with bits and bytes to align requirements and scarce hardware resources
- Implemented classes with painfully long names as I switched to Enterprise Java Development
- Tried my best to make JavaScript app look and behave the same on different browsers and platforms
- Leaarned, applied and shared paradigms of Functional Programming and Composition
- Designed, Implemented and led an [Apprenticeship Program](https://apprenticeship.holidaycheck.com/) to onboard, coach and mentor Junior Engineers
- Led a Development Experience team that revamped the CI infrastructure and created tooling and solutions to enable and empower Engineers
- Organized and facilitated an Open Space conference on Functional Programming for an international audience
- Worked in an international deep-tech consultancy supporting many different international clients
- Supported multiple different teams in different timezones as Engineering Manager
- Revamped and restructured the teams of a startup and enabled them to ship quality software

I would be thrilled to apply my professional experience to support **you**. If you want to take a look at my full cv, you can do so [here](/cv.pdf).
